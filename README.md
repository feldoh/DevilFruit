# Devil Fruits

Re-flavour genepacks to be devil fruits from One Piece.

Settings are provided to allow you to make eating a second fruit ineffective and to hide the effects of the fruit until it is eaten. Even with this enabled the fruit will be named after one of the genes it contains, but you might eat the dark vision fruit and become yellow and grow a tail as well, you just won't know until you eat it.
